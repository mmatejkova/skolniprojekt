    <h2>About Whales</h2>
    <div class="aboutparent container">
            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                Whales are some of the ocean’s most iconic creatures, ranging from the immense blue whale to the acrobatic humpback. These gentle giants are essential to marine ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycles and maintaining healthy food chains. Whales are known for their impressive migrations, often spanning thousands of miles to breed and feed.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, whales face many threats, including ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. Climate change impacts their habitats and food sources, particularly krill and small fish. Noise pollution interferes with their communication and navigation, and some species remain targeted by whaling practices.
                <br><br>
                Efforts to protect whales focus on reducing ship collisions, creating marine protected areas, and promoting sustainable fishing practices. Safeguarding whales is essential for the health of our oceans.

    <h3>Danger</h3>
      <div class="danger container">
        <p>
            Whales face a wide range of dangers in the modern ocean. One of the most severe threats is ship strikes, which injure or kill whales as they migrate or feed near busy shipping routes. Climate change also affects their habitats, reducing the availability of krill and other key food sources, particularly for species like humpbacks and blue whales.
            <br><br>
            Pollution, including plastics and chemicals, threatens whale health, while noise pollution from ships and industrial activity interferes with their communication and migration patterns. Whaling, though reduced in many parts of the world, still occurs in some regions, further endangering certain species. Conservation efforts focus on protecting migration routes, reducing ocean noise, and limiting human impacts to safeguard these iconic marine mammals.

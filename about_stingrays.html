    <h2>About Stingrays</h2>
    <div class="aboutparent container">
            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                Stingrays are graceful and unique creatures found in shallow coastal waters and along coral reefs. With flat bodies and long, whip-like tails, they glide effortlessly along the seafloor, feeding on shellfish, crustaceans, and small fish. Stingrays play a key role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by keeping benthic environments in balance.
                <br><br>
                Despite their resilience, stingrays face increasing threats from human activity. Overfishing targets stingrays for their meat and cartilage, while habitat destruction, especially in coral reefs and mangroves, removes their essential breeding and feeding grounds. Pollution, including plastic waste, also poses a danger to these gentle creatures.
                <br><br>
                Efforts to conserve stingrays include protecting their habitats, regulating fishing practices, and raising awareness about their importance to marine ecosystems.

    <h3>Danger</h3>
      <div class="danger container">
        <p>
            Stingrays, often overshadowed by other marine species, are also at risk from growing human impacts. Habitat destruction, especially in coral reefs and mangroves, removes essential breeding and feeding areas for stingrays. Overfishing not only targets rays directly for their meat and cartilage but also reduces the populations of the smaller fish they rely on for food.
            <br><br>
            Pollution, particularly plastic waste, can harm stingrays through ingestion or entanglement, while warming waters caused by climate change disrupt their habitats and migration patterns. Some stingray species are caught and traded for aquariums, further depleting wild populations. Protecting their habitats and regulating fishing practices are key to their survival.

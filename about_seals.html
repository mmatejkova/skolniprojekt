    <h2>About Seals</h2>
    <div class="aboutparent container">
            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                Seals are fascinating marine mammals found in diverse habitats, from icy Arctic waters to temperate coastlines. With streamlined bodies and sensitive whiskers, seals are expert swimmers and hunters, feeding on fish, squid, and other marine creatures. Social by nature, they often rest in groups on beaches or rocky shores, returning to land or ice during breeding seasons to raise their pups.
                <br><br>
                Despite their adaptability, seals face numerous threats, including climate change, pollution, and entanglement in fishing gear. Overfishing reduces their food supply, and in some regions, seals are still hunted for their fur and oil. Species like the Mediterranean monk seal are critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation.
                <br><br>
                Efforts to protect seals include rescue programs, stricter fishing regulations, and habitat preservation. By safeguarding their environments, we can ensure these vital marine animals continue to thrive in our oceans.

    <h3>Danger</h3>
      <div class="danger container">
        <p>
            Seals face a variety of dangers that threaten their survival, even in their diverse and adaptable habitats. Climate change is one of the most significant threats, causing the loss of sea ice that many species rely on for resting, breeding, and raising their young. Pollution, including plastic waste and oil spills, contaminates their environments and can harm seals through ingestion or entanglement.
            <br><br>
            Fishing industries also pose severe risks, with seals often caught as bycatch or injured by discarded fishing gear. Overfishing depletes the fish stocks they depend on for food, leaving many seals struggling to find enough to eat. In some areas, seals are still hunted for their fur, oil, or as perceived competitors for fish. This is particularly devastating for already endangered species, like the Mediterranean monk seal, which faces the brink of extinction.
            <br><br>
            Without immediate action, these threats could continue to reduce seal populations worldwide. Addressing these challenges through conservation programs, pollution control, and sustainable fishing practices is crucial to their survival.

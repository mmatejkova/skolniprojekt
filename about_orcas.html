    <h2>About Orcas</h2>
    <div class="aboutparent container">
            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                Orcas, or killer whales, are powerful and highly intelligent marine mammals found in oceans worldwide. Known for their striking black-and-white markings, orcas live in tightly knit pods with complex social structures. They are apex predators, hunting fish, seals, and even other whales using coordinated strategies.
                <br><br>
                Orcas face a range of threats, including pollution, which contaminates their food and can lead to long-term health issues. Climate change and overfishing reduce the availability of prey, especially for fish-eating orcas. Noise pollution from shipping and industrial activities interferes with their echolocation, while captivity disrupts wild populations and family groups.
                <br><br>
                Protecting orcas involves addressing pollution, ensuring sustainable fisheries, and safeguarding their habitats. Together, we can secure a future for these remarkable animals.

    <h3>Danger</h3>
      <div class="danger container">
        <p>
            Orcas, or killer whales, face a range of threats that put their populations at risk. Pollution, including toxic chemicals and heavy metals, accumulates in their bodies, causing health problems and reproductive issues. Reduced prey availability, often caused by overfishing and climate change, leaves many orcas struggling to find enough food, especially for fish-dependent populations.
            <br><br>
            Noise pollution from ships and industrial activities interferes with their echolocation, which they rely on for hunting and communication. Captivity has also harmed wild populations, as orcas taken for marine parks disrupt pod dynamics and breeding. Conservation efforts are essential to combat these challenges, focusing on habitat protection, sustainable fishing, and stricter regulations to reduce pollutants.

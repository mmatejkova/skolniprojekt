    <h2>About Sharks</h2>
    <div class="aboutparent container">
            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                Sharks are ancient predators that have roamed the oceans for over 400 million years. As apex predators, they play a critical role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. With keen senses and streamlined bodies, sharks are highly efficient hunters, feeding on fish, squid, and other marine life.
                <br><br>
                However, many shark species are now at risk due to human activities. Overfishing, driven by the demand for shark fins and meat, has drastically reduced their populations. Sharks are often caught as bycatch, and habitat destruction further threatens their survival. Pollution and climate change also disrupt their environments and food sources.
                <br><br>
                Conservation measures such as regulating fisheries, protecting habitats, and banning shark finning are vital to ensuring the survival of these essential marine predators.

    <h3>Danger</h3>
      <div class="danger container">
        <p>
            Sharks are under significant threat from human activities, despite being essential for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. Overfishing, driven by the demand for shark fins, meat, and liver oil, has drastically reduced populations of many species. Sharks are also frequently caught as bycatch in commercial fishing operations, often leading to unnecessary deaths.
            <br><br>
            Habitat destruction and pollution, including microplastics and chemical runoff, further harm sharks by degrading their environments. Climate change disrupts their breeding grounds and alters prey availability, making survival even harder. Without urgent conservation measures, many shark species could face extinction, which would have far-reaching consequences for ocean ecosystems.

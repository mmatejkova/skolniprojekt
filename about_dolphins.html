    <h2>About Dolphins</h2>
    <div class="aboutparent container">
            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                Dolphins are intelligent and social marine mammals found in oceans and rivers worldwide. Known for their playful behavior and advanced communication skills, dolphins use echolocation to hunt fish, squid, and other prey. They live in complex social groups called pods, forming strong bonds and working together to navigate their environment.
                <br><br>
                Despite their adaptability, dolphins face significant threats from human activities. Pollution, such as plastics and chemicals, contaminates their habitats, while noise pollution disrupts their communication and navigation. Many dolphins are caught as bycatch in fishing nets, and habitat destruction further endangers their populations. Some species, like the Maui dolphin, are critically endangered.
                <br><br>
                Conservation efforts include reducing bycatch, limiting pollution, and protecting critical habitats. By taking these steps, we can help ensure dolphins continue to thrive in the wild.

    <h3>Danger</h3>
      <div class="danger container">
        <p>
            Dolphins face numerous threats in their ocean habitats, many of which are caused by human activities. Pollution, such as plastic waste and toxic chemicals, contaminates their waters, often leading to illness or death. Noise pollution from boats, underwater drilling, and military sonar disrupts their communication and navigation, essential for hunting and social bonding.
            <br><br>
            Bycatch in fishing nets is another significant danger, with thousands of dolphins accidentally caught and killed annually. Habitat destruction from coastal development and climate change further reduces their living spaces. Some species, like the Maui dolphin, are critically endangered due to these combined pressures. Protecting dolphins requires reducing pollution, enforcing sustainable fishing practices, and preserving their habitats.

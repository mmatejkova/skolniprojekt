    <h2>About Penguins</h2>
    <div class="aboutparent container">
            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>
                Penguins are flightless seabirds that thrive in some of the world’s most extreme environments, from icy Antarctic coasts to temperate island shores. Adapted for swimming, they use their wings as flippers to chase fish, krill, and squid underwater. Penguins are highly social, forming large colonies during breeding seasons to raise their chicks.
                <br><br>
                However, penguins face growing threats. Climate change is melting the sea ice many species rely on for breeding and hunting, while overfishing depletes their food supply. Pollution, such as oil spills and plastic waste, further endangers their habitats, and human disturbance disrupts nesting sites.
                <br><br>
                Protecting penguins requires addressing climate change, conserving their habitats, and promoting sustainable fishing practices. These efforts are essential to ensuring the survival of these beloved birds.

    <h3>Danger</h3>
      <div class="danger container">
        <p>
            Penguins face mounting challenges in their icy and temperate habitats. Climate change is a primary threat, as melting sea ice reduces breeding grounds for species like the emperor penguin and disrupts food chains. Overfishing depletes their primary food sources, such as krill and small fish, forcing penguins to travel farther to feed, often at great risk.
            <br><br>
            Pollution, including oil spills and plastic waste, poses additional dangers by contaminating their environments and harming their health. Human disturbance, from tourism and coastal development, can disrupt nesting sites, leaving penguins vulnerable. Protecting penguin colonies and addressing climate change are crucial steps in securing their future.
